Segment_tree_for_mass_ops and Segment_tree_for_lazy_propagation is used for questions where the 
     updation is done on a range and the query is asked for a point or range. However where
     each has to be used is explained next. 

Segment_tree_for_mass_ops.cpp is used when range queries with commutative and associative operation is asked
     ,i.e, the operation here refers to that operation where the two child nodes of the segment tree 
     that is needed to be performed to get the parent of these nodes in the segment tree.


Segment_tree_for_lazy_propagation.cpp is used when range queries with non commutative operation is asked
     ,i.e, the operation here refers to that operation where the two child nodes of the segment tree 
     that is needed to be performed to get the parent of these nodes in the segment tree.


Segment_tree_for_min.cpp and Segment_tree_for_sum is used in case where the updation is done in point
     and the query is done for a range
